# The 2nd Eagle Father & Son Invitational — Trip HQ

Single-file web app (`index.html`, no build step, no backend) that runs a Scotland golf
trip: day-by-day schedule, WHS handicap calculator, and a two-team cup competition with live
scoreboard, groupings view, and individual net leaderboard. State persists to `localStorage`
on the device, there is no server. Branded as the Father & Son Invitational (navy/blue logo
palette); the app still lives in the `handicap-calculator-scotland` repo.

- **Live**: served straight from `index.html` (open the file or host statically).
- **Repo**: `GTMpath/handicap-calculator-scotland` (public). Push as `GTMpath` or
  `spartacus3131` — run `gh auth switch` first; the machine defaults to another account.
- **Trip dates**: Jul 8–14 2026. Roster: Brett, Bruce, Kyle, Ron, Andrew, Mike, Justin, Robert.
- **Teams**: Fife (A, sea green) vs Angus (B, terracotta), two father-son duos each.

## Architecture (all inside `index.html`)

- `<style>` — design tokens live in `:root` (see Design system below). One mobile media
  query at `max-width:640px`.
- `COURSES` — the five courses + Kingsbarns, realistic tees only, with CR/Slope/Par per tee.
  Carnoustie plays par 70 off the Yellows/Greens; that per-tee `par` override matters.
- `SCHEDULE` — the seven trip days; golf days link to a course by `id`.
- `ROUND_CFG` — the 5-round cup format, ONE source of truth. To change a round, edit one line.
  `team: 'pairs'|'singles'` are match play (tap the winner); `'foursome'` is stroke (enter
  scores, best-N team net wins the point). LOCKED plan (confirmed 2026-07-01): R1 Kingsbarns
  pairings better ball, R2 Dumbarnie pairings combined, R3 Carnoustie team foursome best-2,
  R4 St Andrews New singles (the mix round), R5 St Andrews Old team foursome best-4. Points
  2/2/1/4/1 = 10, 5½ to win. Everyone plays with their partner/team 4 of 5 rounds.
- `ROUND_GROUPS` — playing groups per round (who walks together). Pairings rounds rotate
  opponents; team rounds put each full team together; the New singles mixes so nobody is with
  their partner. `matchesForRound` (pairs) and `groupsForRound` both read this. UI calls them
  "pairings," not "duos" (internal `duos`/`teamDuos`/`SEED_DUOS` names kept).
- State: `players`, `teeChoice`, `allowance`, `rounds` where each round is
  `{scores:{pid:gross}, results:{matchIdx:'A'|'B'|'half'}}`, saved under `LS_KEY`
  (`fs-invitational-v9`; bump the suffix when the shape changes). Teams are LOCKED to the seed.
- Render functions are named `render*`; live in-place updaters (`updateMatchLive`,
  `updateIndividualLive`) exist so typing a score doesn't drop input focus.

## Handicap math

`Course HCP = Index × (Slope ÷ 113) + (Course Rating − Par)`, rounded. Playing HCP applies
the comp allowance. Net = gross − rounded Course HCP. Match play: low net wins, 1 pt, ½ tied.
Better Ball takes a duo's lower net; Aggregate adds both. Every format is own-ball.

## Design system

Navy/blue heraldic identity taken from the event logo (was a green newsprint look).
- Palette (`:root`): `--paper` #e7ecf3, `--card` #f7f9fc, `--ink` #16243f (navy),
  `--gorse` #3f5c8c (denim/saltire, the ACCENT, name kept from the old palette),
  `--teamA` #16243f (Fife navy), `--teamB` #8a3b46 (Angus claret). JS `TEAM_COLORS` must
  match `--teamA/--teamB`.
- Type: Space Grotesk (display), Inter (body), Space Mono (data/labels/eyebrows).
- Ruled-paper background, 2px ink borders, dark navy tab bar with a denim active tab (white
  text + bottom accent). Masthead has an `assets/logo.png` slot with an SVG crest fallback.
- Keep the boldness in the signature (masthead + the live scoreboard). Everything else quiet.

## Gotchas

- `localStorage` writes are wrapped in try/catch — a sandboxed preview silently no-ops
  persistence; that's expected, not a bug.
- `.card-line .k` labels are **mobile-only** card labels. They must be `display:none` on
  desktop or they duplicate the table header inside every cell.
- Bump `LS_KEY` whenever the saved-state shape changes, or returning users load stale data.
- iOS zooms on focus if inputs are <16px — the mobile query already bumps them to 16px.

## Session logs

One dated file per working session in `sessions/`. Newest wins for "where did we leave off."
